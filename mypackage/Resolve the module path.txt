 go get github.com/me/hello/mypackage


This command tells Go to add or update a dependency on the module that provides the package github.com/me/hello/mypackage — and download it into your module cache.
But here’s the twist: Go modules operate at the module level, not the package level. So when you run:  go get github.com/me/hello/mypackage




Go tries to:
- Resolve the module path — usually github.com/me/hello
- Check if that module contains the package mypackage
- Download the module and update your go.mod and go.sum accordingly




✅ When it works:
- The module github.com/me/hello exists and is tagged (e.g. v0.1.0)
- The go.mod in that repo says:
	module github.com/me/hello
- And the subdirectory mypackage/ contains Go code with:
	package mypackage
